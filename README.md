# code oil
Code Oil is a web app that provides Javascript practice problems that you can test and verify in the browser. It's designed to be very easy for beginning
programmers.

Practice problems are stored in `solutions/`. Pull requests welcome.

More to come later on the overall architecture once things stabilize a bit more.
